# Heroes-API-EFC-.NET6
.NET 6 Full CRUD with Entity Framework Core and web API.

In this project i have create a CRUD web api for heroes.
You can create,read,update,delete a hero. In addition i have use Entity Framework Core and Code First technique.

I have use the following technologies:
- C#
- .NET 6
- Entity Framework Core

In addition i have implement the following:
- Pagination (both page number and page size)
- Sorting based on property (using dynamic LINQ)
- Filtering
- API throttling
- Enable Cors
- Serilog (write to log file in project directory)

Within the next days i will implement generic repository pattern to seperate my database layer from business logic.
